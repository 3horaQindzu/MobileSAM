A nulled version of a plugin is a cracked or modified version that bypasses the license verification process. Nulled plugins are often distributed on shady websites that claim to offer them for free. However, downloading and using nulled plugins can be very risky and harmful for your website. Here are some of the reasons why you should avoid nulled plugins:
 
- Nulled plugins can contain malware, viruses, or backdoors that can infect your website and compromise its security. Hackers can use nulled plugins to access your website and steal your data, inject malicious code, redirect your traffic, or even take over your website.
- Nulled plugins can cause compatibility issues with other plugins or themes on your website. Nulled plugins are often outdated or poorly coded, which can result in errors, conflicts, or crashes on your website. This can affect your website's performance and functionality.
- Nulled plugins can violate the intellectual property rights of the original developers. Nulled plugins are illegal and unethical, as they deprive the developers of their deserved income and recognition. By using nulled plugins, you are supporting piracy and disrespecting the hard work of the developers.

Therefore, if you want to use Clipbucket Mass Embedder Pro on your website, you should buy it from the official website of Clipbucket. This way, you can get a genuine and updated version of the plugin that works smoothly and securely on your website.
