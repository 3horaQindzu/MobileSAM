### 1. Use keyboard shortcuts
 
One of the best ways to speed up your editing process is to use keyboard shortcuts. Lightworks has a lot of keyboard shortcuts that can help you perform various actions quickly and easily. For example, you can use J, K, and L to play, pause, and rewind your video, or use I and O to mark in and out points. You can also customize your own keyboard shortcuts by going to System Settings > Keyboard.
 
### 2. Use the VFX workspace
 
The VFX workspace is where you can add effects, filters, transitions, and text to your video clips. You can access it by clicking on the VFX tab at the top right corner of the screen. To add an effect, simply drag and drop it from the Effects panel onto your clip or FX track. You can adjust the parameters of the effect in the Graphs panel. To add text, click on the Titles button and choose a template. You can edit the text in the Text panel.
 
### 3. Use proxies for smoother playback
 
If you are working with high-resolution or large video files, you might experience lagging or stuttering during playback. This can make it hard to edit your video accurately and efficiently. To solve this problem, you can use proxies, which are lower-quality versions of your original files that are easier to play back. To enable proxies, go to Project Settings > Video > Proxy Media Quality and choose a quality level. Lightworks will automatically create proxies for your imported media.
 
### 4. Use milestones to save versions of your project
 
Milestones are a feature that allows you to save different versions of your project without creating multiple files. This can help you keep track of your progress and revert to a previous version if needed. To create a milestone, go to Project Contents > Milestones and click on the + button. You can name your milestone and add a description. To restore a milestone, right-click on it and choose Restore.
 
### 5. Watch tutorials and learn from others
 
One of the best ways to learn how to use Lightworks is to watch tutorials and learn from others who have experience with this software. There are many online resources that can help you master Lightworks, such as YouTube videos[^1^], Short Cuts[^2^], and the official Lightworks website[^3^]. You can also join the Lightworks community forum and ask questions, share tips, and get feedback from other users.
